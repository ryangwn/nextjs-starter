# Based on https://steveholgado.com/nginx-for-nextjs/

# - /var/cache/nginx sets a directory to store the cached assets
# - levels=1:2 sets up a two‑level directory hierarchy as file access speed can be reduced when too many files are in a single directory
# - keys_zone=STATIC:10m defines a shared memory zone for cache keys named “STATIC” and with a size limit of 10MB (which should be more than enough unless you have thousands of files)
# - inactive=7d is the time that items will remain cached without being accessed (7 days), after which they will be removed
# - use_temp_path=off tells NGINX to write files directly to the cache directory and avoid unnecessary copying of data to a temporary storage area first
